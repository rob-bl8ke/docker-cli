File watching not working on Windows is a common issue with Docker volumes and file system events. Here's why this happens and the solutions:

### Why File Watching Doesn't Work on Windows
- File System Events: Linux file systems (like ext4) generate inotify events when files change, which React's development server can detect. Windows file systems (NTFS) handle file change notifications differently.

- Docker Volume Mounting: When you mount a Windows directory into a Linux container (which is what happens with Docker Desktop on Windows), the file system event propagation doesn't work properly between the Windows host and Linux container.

- React Scripts Polling: React's development server relies on these file system events for hot reloading.

## Solutions
Here are several solutions you can try:

### Solution 1: Enable Polling in React Scripts (Recommended)
Modify your Dockerfile.dev to set the `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING` environment variable:

Solution 2: Alternative - Set Environment Variable in Docker Compose
Alternatively, you could set the environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml`:

### Solution 3: Additional Options for Better Performance
You can also add additional environment variables for better performance:

## How to Test the Fix

- Rebuild your containers:
- Make a change to your App.js file and see if the React app automatically reloads.

What These Environment Variables Do
- `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`: Forces the file watcher to use polling instead of file system events
- `CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL=1000`: Sets the polling interval to 1 second (reduces CPU usage compared to default 100ms)
- `WATCHPACK_POLLING=true`: Enables polling for webpack's file watching (used by React Scripts)

## Trade-offs

- Pros: File watching will work on Windows

- Cons: Slightly higher CPU usage due to polling, and there might be a small delay (1 second with the interval I set) before changes are detected
This should resolve your file watching issues on Windows! The polling approach is the most reliable solution for cross-platform Docker development with React.

- [Outdated poll option for webpack watcher](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/12397) - for when the webpack watcher doesn't detect files changes on Windows. This workaround resolves reloading the web application but does not help with re-running the tests. Jest allows one to interact with the tests and so this is less of an issue with
